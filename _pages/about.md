Hi, welcome to my website!

I am a **researcher in systems and computational neuroscience**. As such, I divide my time between experiments (high-density electrophysiology, optogenetics, rodent behaviour) and modelling (biophysical modelling, deep learning, dynamical systems).

Some of my work:

- A deep-learning approach to predict neuron type identity from their electrical signature ([Beau et al., Cell, 2025](https://bsky.app/profile/maxime-beau.bsky.social/post/3ljcytuuulk25) - see [c4-database.com](www.c4-database.com))
- [NeuroPyxels](https://github.com/m-beau/NeuroPyxels), a generalist Python package to analyze [Neuropixels](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24636) data
- The discovery of reward signals encoded in the plasticity-inducing pathway of the cerebellum ([Kostadinov et al., 2019, Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0381-8))

I received my **Ph.D. in Neuroscience** from University College London in 2024. There, I studied information transmission across the output pathway of the cerebellum in behaving rodents, using in vivo high-density electrophysiology and optogenetics. I was also the lead author of an international collaboration who developed a deep-learning approach to identify neural cell-types from their electrophysiological properties. I was co-advised by Prof. Michael Häusser and Prof. Beverley Clark, under the mentorship of Dr. Dimitar Kostadinov, and collaborated with Prof. Steve Lisberger and Prof. Javier Medina.

**Before that**, I studied medicine and neuroscience as part of an MD-PhD programme shared between Université Paris Descartes, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, and École Normale Supérieure. In this context, I worked in the lab of Boris Barbour at École Normale Supérieure, where I was advised by Dr Jonas Ranft.

I also practice Shotokan Karate, which I tought at the Kentish town Karate club in London, UK, from 2022 to 2025. I also love cooking French cuisine and brewing tasty espresso, especially for friends!
